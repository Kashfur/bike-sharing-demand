# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction README

## Introduction
The availability and accessibility of rental bikes in urban cities are essential for enhancing mobility and reducing waiting times. Predicting the number of rental bikes required at each hour is crucial to ensure a stable supply of bikes. This project aims to predict bike rental demand based on various environmental and seasonal factors.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
1. **Date**: Date and time of the observation
2. **Rented Bike Count**: Number of bikes rented
3. **Hour**: Hour of the day
4. **Temperature**: Temperature in Celsius
5. **Humidity**: Humidity level in percentage
6. **Wind Speed**: Wind speed in meters per second
7. **Visibility**: Visibility in meters
8. **Dew Point Temperature**: Dew point temperature in Celsius
9. **Solar Radiation**: Solar radiation in MJ/m2
10. **Rainfall**: Rainfall in millimeters
11. **Snowfall**: Snowfall in centimeters
12. **Seasons**: Season of the year (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)
13. **Holiday**: Whether it is a holiday or not
14. **Functional Day**: Whether it is a functional day or not

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**: The dataset is explored to understand its structure and identify any patterns or trends.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Null values are handled, and the data is formatted appropriately for analysis. Outliers are detected and removed, and features with high multicollinearity are eliminated.
3. **Feature Engineering**: New features may be created or existing features may be modified to improve model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests are trained on the preprocessed data to predict bike rental demand.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error, etc.
6. **Model Deployment**: The best-performing model is deployed for real-world prediction of bike rental demand.

## Conclusion
By accurately predicting bike rental demand, urban cities can optimize bike-sharing systems, improve user experience, and ensure a stable supply of rental bikes to the public. This project aims to provide insights and tools to help achieve these objectives.
